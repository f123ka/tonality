== Feature Overview

Tonality provides a piano view, to allow to play on a simple piano keyboard.

Features:

* Piano view to play with
* Optional key labelling
* Dynamic sizing of the keyboard
* Stack multiple keyboards
* Scale highlighting

=== TODO before 1.0

* [x] Implement preferences dialog
* [x] add reset button to sizing dialog
* [x] I18N of scale names
* [x] popups shall have a proper shadow / elevation
* [x] fix display bug for octave right in sizing popup
* [x] use circle of fifths to select root note
* [-] label too high in horizontal mode
* [-] automate updating semitone
* [ ] add nice app icon
* [ ] automate building from scratch to ease use in f-droid
* [ ] minify apks, strip unneeded semitone assets
* [ ] publish in Play Store and on f-droid

=== Possible next features ... or just a bunch of ideas

* [ ] highlight (and optionally label) some important intervals based on the root note
* [ ] harmonize handling of pianoview parameters in preferences (currently in PianoView and PianoFragment)
* [ ] grey out or hide notes which cannot be played due to missing sound file
* [ ] create custom textviews which take note name, piano, handler and item to position around
* [ ] add some open source synth to tonality in order to play more than audio files
* [ ] add more scales

== Feature Overview

Tonality provides a piano view, to allow to play on a simple piano keyboard.
Based on a root note, different scales can be highlighted on the keyboard to
ease learning of a scale.

Features:

* Piano view to play with
* Optional key labelling
* Dynamic sizing of the keyboard
* Stack multiple keyboards
* Scale highlighting

=== Possible next features ... or just a bunch of ideas

* [ ] highlight (and optionally label) some important intervals based on the root note
* [ ] harmonize handling of pianoview parameters in preferences (currently in PianoView and PianoFragment)
* [ ] grey out or hide notes which cannot be played due to missing sound file
* [ ] create custom textviews which take note name, piano, handler and item to position around
* [ ] add some open source synth to tonality in order to play more than audio files
* [ ] add more scales

== Development

=== Build instructinos

* checkout tonality
* Ensure the environment variable `ANDROID_NDK` is set
* Ensure that gradle can call `patch` and `git`, i.e. these should be on your `PATH`
* Prepare dependencies - this will pull git submodules and build native ffmpeg binaries
    - `gradle setupTonalityDependencies` +
* build tonality:
    - `gradle build`

=== Interaction with upstream semitone

You will probably need these only as a maintainer of the project.

These commands assume that remotes named `semitone-upstream` and `semitone-as-a-library`.
have been set up.

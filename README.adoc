=== Possible next features ... or just a bunch of ideas

* [ ] harmonize handling of pianoview parameters in preferences (currently in PianoView and PianoFragment)
* [ ] grey out or hide notes which cannot be played due to missing sound file
* [ ] add some open source synth to tonality in order to play more than audio files
* [ ] improve scale selection with custom dialog and scale grouping
* [ ] add MIDI keyboard support via USB on the go
* [ ] add metronome to piano view
* [ ] automate screenshot generation combined with espresso UI testing
* [ ] add link to google play, fix link to f-droid once published there

== Development


=== Build instructinos

* checkout tonality
* Ensure the environment variable `ANDROID_NDK` is set
* Ensure that gradle can call `patch` and `git`, i.e. these should be on your `PATH`
* Prepare dependencies - this will pull git submodules and build native ffmpeg binaries
    - `gradle setupTonalityDependencies` +
* build tonality:
    - `gradle build`


=== Interaction with upstream semitone

You will probably need these only as a maintainer of the project.

These commands assume that remotes named `semitone-upstream` and `semitone-as-a-library`.
have been set up.

pull::
    * commit all changes
    * `git subtree pull --prefix semitone semitone-upstream master`
    * convert semitone into an android library by changing semitone/build.gradle
        - change build gradle plugin to library
        - comment out application ID

push::
    * commit all changes
    * `git subtree push --prefix semitone semitone-fork semitone-as-a-library`
    * add pull request towards semitone project
